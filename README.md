# WellNest

Having witnessed firsthand the challenges that one of our teammates' grandparents faces living alone, we became acutely aware of the difficulties involved in maintaining their health and well-being. Elders like them struggle with remembering daily health updates, deciding when to seek medical attention, and navigating modern technology. This experience deeply inspired us to create WellNestâ€”an app designed not only to simplify health tracking and make it accessible for elders with speech-to-text capabilities but also to provide peace of mind for both seniors and their families. By offering an AI-powered 100% speech-to-text system, WellNest allows seniors to effortlessly record their health updates, which can be easily shared with doctors. This data exchange helps medical professionals assess conditions more accurately and efficiently, improving care and ensuring that both seniors and their families feel more connected and supported in managing health. Our goal is to make it easier for seniors to manage their health, reduce stress, and foster a sense of security in their daily lives.
